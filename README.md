# dev-project-settings

Project settings used in development projects, including settings files for IDEs.

This project can be viewed as the development equivalent to the [dotfiles](https://github.com/marvey11/dotfiles) project (which aims at setting up the Operating System).

# Current Setting

Support has been added for the `.editorconfig` file.

Furthermore, the `settings.json` file -- which stores the user (or local environment) settings for Visual Studio Code.
